# Medieval2-EDU-Editor
A simple python script that can read and write. Very barebones for now, will just read and write a new file.
Edit main() to create any mass changes desired. Plans for a shell and GUI coming soon (tm) and making it work for RTW and it's remaster.

KNOWN ISSUES
*************

The vanilla EDU file will create an error due to every single elephant lacking a space after
a comma in the formations line. I will make it so that's a non issue later but for now just manually
space out those data entries.

Adding a property to a unit that necessitates a new line will off set the commented_out data and will
make it comment out incorrect lines. Already thinking of how to deal with that.
